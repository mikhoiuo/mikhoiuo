i'm a high school junior with bad grades and way too many projects. i like machine learning and i like learning theory. i'm always up to figure out a new language or library or whatever because i like knowing how to assemble things, start to finish. you will probably find me using obscure programming languages and also hating myself for using obscure programming language. big advocate of reading the docs. i don't know what else to write man.
